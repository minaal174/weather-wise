/**
 * Instructions for updating the WeatherWise app icon
 * 
 * 1. Save the WeatherWise logo image provided in the chat to your local computer
 * 2. Replace the following files with the new logo:
 *    - assets/images/icon.png (1024x1024 recommended for app stores)
 *    - assets/images/adaptive-icon.png (foreground image for Android adaptive icons)
 *    - assets/images/favicon.png (smaller version for web favicon)
 *    - assets/images/splash-icon.png (for the splash screen)
 * 
 * 3. Make sure the image has the proper dimensions and transparent background
 * 4. For best results, create appropriate sizes for each platform:
 *    - iOS: icon.png should be 1024x1024 pixels
 *    - Android: adaptive-icon.png should be 1024x1024 pixels with important content in the center 512x512 area
 *    - Web: favicon.png should be 196x196 pixels
 * 
 * 5. After replacing the icons, rebuild and deploy your app
 * 
 * For automated icon generation, consider using a tool like:
 * - https://github.com/expo/expo-cli (eas build)
 * - https://easyappicon.com/ (online generator)
 * - https://appicon.co/ (online generator)
